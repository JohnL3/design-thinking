# How might we...

...improve the overall processes from content conception to live content.

## What will you hear?

_When you interview your users, what do you think they will think needs change (or does not) in your chosen challenge space?_

- More time planning before starting a project
- Working on too many project at the same time
- Planned maintenance
- closer collaboration with other departments
- Don't restrict the creative process
- Don't complicate the process
- Help to provide structure
- Streamline operations
- Reduce complexity across assets storage
- Automate as much as possible
- Provide a single source of truth
- Provide documentation
- Organise assets/tasks
- Reduce variation and complexity in ClickUp
- Utilise version control
- Keep two-week sprints in line with Engineering Team for the deployment process

#### Note

We focused only on our programme team for this task and we probably need to broaden our user base for example Engineering team

## What will you see?

_When you observe people and things interacting in your challenge space, what do you expect to see?_

- Frustration in not been able to make timely changes to content 
- Variations in use of ClickUp
- Variations in approach to syllabus/script/content creation
- Variations in asset storage
- Variations in style of wording used in docs and tasks
- Lack of documentation for processes
- Lack of clarity on ownership of tasks
- Tight (unachievable) deadlines for content creation
- Errors slipping through into live content
- Repeated tasks and operations
- Unactioned comments or review points on scripts
- Inaccessible files in Google Drive
- Restrictions from Media login code requirements
- Disorganised storage

## Possible Solutions

_We all do it. You've already thought of some solutions, haven't you? Go ahead and write them down here. Get them out of your head._

- Use organised folder structures for assets
- Stricter templating for clickup script writing, so all content creators work to the same process
- GitHub
- git
- Automated creation of docs and tasks
- GitHub actions
