## What is design thinking?

[Stanford d.school 5 step process](https://dschool.stanford.edu/)

2 phases:

- find the problem
  - Empathise
    - Talk to stake holders (users)
    - What is it
    - How should it help
  - Define
    - Target audience
- solution finding phase
  - Ideate
    - As many solutions as possible
  - Prototype
    - Build out potential solutions
  - Test
    - Test efficacy of implemented solution

## Three approaches to design process

- Infinite loop : design is conitnuous, always check in with users, CICD
  - [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/design/)
- SAP model : Discover | Design | Deliver
  - [SAP](https://apphaus.sap.com/)
- Short sprint : Entire design process in one week sprint
  - [Google](https://www.gv.com/sprint/)

## The value of design thinking

[Design management index](https://www.dmi.org/page/DesignValue/The-Value-of-Design-.htm)

Ensure to have a metric that can be measured before and after the process  

- What will you measure
- Qualitative measures, e.g. getting feedback from your users
 - Are all departments our users or is it a case that some departments are our users more than others
